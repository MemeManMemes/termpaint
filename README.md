# THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS WITH LINUX MACHINES WITH THE BASH KERNEL 

# Termpaint
Alright, so I made this application because I really like terminal/kernel text editors and instead of making just another text editor, I decided to make a painting editor!  Compile with ```g++ -std=c++20```

## Usage:
### Colors:
Space bar  :  Reset square <br/>
1 key  :  Paint white<br/>
2 key  :  Paint red<br/>
3 key  :  Paint orange<br/>
4 key  :  Paint yellow<br/>
5 key  :  Paint green<br/>
6 key  :  Paint cyan<br/>
7 key  :  Paint blue<br/>
8 key  :  paint purple<br/>
Pressing shift and a color at the same same will paint a lighter version of that color except for orange and yellow

A key  :  Change X position on canvas left by one
